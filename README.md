# firefox-altnumber

This extension adds keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs with Alt+Number, similar
to Firefox on Linux's shortcuts.

This is effectively a tweaked version of the original
[firefox-ctrlnumber](https://github.com/AbigailBuccaneer/firefox-ctrlnumber)
extension.

## Installation

This extension can be installed from the Firefox Add-ons site.

## Building from source

    yarn install && yarn run test && yarn run build
    ls web-ext-artifacts/ # this directory now contains the extension .zip file
